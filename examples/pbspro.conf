#
# Example: deploy a PBSPro cluster on CentOS7 VMs
#
# This example covers the installation of a PBSPro cluster with 4
# execution nodes and one login/front-end node (which runs PBSPro
# resource manager daemon, scheduler, and TPP communication service,
# plus NFS server for home directories, and NIS/YP server for
# accounts).  **Note:** ElastiCluster supports installing PBSPro on
# CentOS7 only. (As of January 2019.)
#
# This configuration also demoes how to enable the Ganglia monitoring
# add-on: Ganglia will be running on every compute node, with metrics
# collected and graphed on the front-end (open URL
# http://master001/ganglia)
#
# The configuration is *incomplete* and needs to be complemented with a suitable
# `cloud` section.
#
# For more details about the configuration, see:
# - http://elasticluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configure.html
# - http://elasticluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/playbooks.html#id4
