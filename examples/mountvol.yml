# Provision a storage volume on AWS, attach it to the cluster's
# master/front-end node, and make it available under directory
# `/work`.  You need to edit this playbook to plug the correct values
# into the `vars:` section.
#
# This playbook should be run *after* ElastiCluster has set up the
# cluster, for instance using::
#
#         elasticluster setup mycluster -- /path/to/mountvol.yml
#
- name: Mount volume on head node

    - after
    - local

  # instead of SLURM

  vars:
    # replace `i-XXXXXX` with the instance ID of the master node
    head_node_id: i-XXXXXXXX
    # replace `vdb` with the actual device name you want/need to use
`sdb`, `xdb`, etc.
