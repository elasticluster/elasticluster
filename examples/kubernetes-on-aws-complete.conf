#
# Example: deploy a Kubernetes cluster on AWS
#
# This example covers the installation of a Kubernetes cluster with 1 master
# node and 4 worker nodes.  This configuration also shows how to use different
# node instance types/flavor for different node groups (notably a 2-core instance
# runs the K8s master whereas 8-core instances are used for the workers).
#
# For more details about the configuration, see:
