# ElastiCluster Example: R Studio on Google Cloud
#
# This example shows how to set up a single-node R Studio Server:
# ElastiCluster will provision a virtual machine, install R Studio
# Server (Open-Source Edition) and configure it to listen on the
# default port 8787.
#
# This is a complete and self-contained example that should get you
# started with running R Studio servers on Google Cloud Engine.
# You can replace the `[cloud/*]` and `[login/*]` sections
# to get a JupyterHub server running on any other cloud.
#
# In order to use the R Studio server:
#
# 1. Note down the IP address of the server VM created by ElastiCluster
# 2. In your browser, open https://server.ip:8787/
# 3. Log in using username and password
#
# Note that you must edit the default security group to allow
# connections to port 8787!
#


# R Studio Server software to be configured by Ansible
#
# (There is nothing Google-specific in the "setup" section; in fact, it can be
# re-used verbatim with *any* cloud provider or base image)
