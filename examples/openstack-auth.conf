# Example: how to configure ElastiCluster to use an OpenStack cloud
#
# This example only covers authentication information; you need to complement it
# with `setup`, `login`, and `cluster` sections.
#
# For more details about ElastiCluster's configuration, see:
# http://elasticluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configure.html
#

[cloud/openstack]
provider=openstack
#
# the following keys are optional: if missing, value will be taken from the
# corresponding `OS_*` environmental variable (e.g., instead of writing
# `password=` here, you can set `OS_PASSWORD` in the environment)
#
auth_url=https://openstack.example.com:5000/v2.0
project_name=elasticluster
username=me
password=secret
# if `identity_api_version` is missing (and `OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION` is not set
# in the environment) then ElastiCluster will try to autodetect
identity_api_version=2
