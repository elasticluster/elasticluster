# Prepare the image:
# 1. move user `root`'s home to `/home` where we shall mount
#    the corresponding host directories where user data resides
# 2. create mountpoints for volumes
RUN : \
    && mkdir -p /home /home/.ssh /home/.elasticluster \
    && sed -re '1s|:/root:|:/home:|' -i /etc/passwd \
    ;
VOLUME /home/.ssh
VOLUME /home/.elasticluster


# Copy ElastiCluster sources
COPY ./ /home


# Install ElastiCluster
#
# This happens in three stages:
# 1. install OS-level deps of Python packages; note that we install
#    explicitly both the development version of a library (needed by
#    `setup.py` in some Python packages) and the DLL-only version of
#    the same -- this is to avoid that DDLs are removed by
#    `apt-get autoremove` later on
# 2. install ElastiCluster and dependent Python packages (with `pip install`)
# 3. cleanup and remove software used for installation to get a leaner image
#
