#                   Sample configuration file for slurmdbd
###############################################################################
#
# /etc/slurm-llnl/slurmdb.conf is an ASCII file which describes Slurm
# Database Daemon (SlurmDBD) configuration information.
# The contents of the file are case insensitive except for the names of
# nodes and files. Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is
# treated as a comment through the end of that line. The size of each
# line in the file is limited to 1024 characters. Changes to the
# configuration file take effect upon restart of SlurmDbd or daemon
# receipt of the SIGHUP signal unless otherwise noted.
#
# This file should be only on the computer where SlurmDBD executes and
# should only be readable by the user which executes SlurmDBD (e.g.
# "slurm"). This file should be protected from unauthorized access since
# it contains a database password.

# AuthType
# Define the authentication method for communications between
# SLURM components. Acceptable values at present include
# "auth/none", "auth/authd", and "auth/munge". The default value
# is "auth/none", which means the UID included in communication
# messages is not verified. This may be fine for testing
# purposes, but do not use "auth/none" if you desire any security.
# "auth/authd" indicates that Brett Chun’s authd is to be used
# (see "http://www.theether.org/authd/" for more information).
# "auth/munge" indicates that LLNL’s Munge system is to be used
# (this is the best supported authentication mechanism for SLURM,
# see "http://home.gna.org/munge/" for more information).
# SlurmDbd must be terminated prior to changing the value of
# AuthType and later restarted.
AuthType=auth/munge

# AuthInfo
# Additional information to be used for authentication of
# communications with the Slurm control daemon (slurmctld) on each
# cluster. The interpretation of this option is specific to the
# configured AuthType. In the case of auth/munge, this can be
# configured to use a Munge daemon specifically configured to provide
# authentication between clusters while the default Munge daemon
# provides authentication within a cluster. In that case, this
# will specify the pathname of the socket to use. The default
# value is NULL, which results in the default authentication
# mechanism being used.
AuthInfo=/var/run/munge/munge.socket.2

# DbdHost
# The name of the machine where the Slurm Database Daemon is
# executed. This should be a node name without the full domain
# name (e.g. "lx0001"). This value must be specified.
DbdHost=localhost

# DbdPort
# The port number that the Slurm Database Daemon (slurmdbd)
# listens to for work. The default value is SLURMDBD_PORT as
# established at system build time. If none is explicitly
# specified, it will be set to 6819. This value must be equal
# to the SlurmDbdPort parameter in the slurm.conf file.

# DebugLevel
# The level of detail to provide the Slurm Database Daemon’s logs.
# Values from 0 to 7 are legal, with ‘0’ being "quiet" operation
# and ‘7’ being insanely verbose. The default value is 3.
DebugLevel=3

# MessageTimeout
# Time permitted for a round-trip  communication  to  complete  in
# seconds. Default value is 10 seconds.

# StorageHost
# Define the name of the host the database is running where we are
# going to store the data. Ideally this should be the host on
# which slurmdbd executes.
StorageHost=localhost

# StorageLoc
# Specify the name of the database as the location where
# accounting records are written.
StorageLoc={{slurmdbd_mysql_db}}

# StoragePass
# Define the password used to gain access to the database to store
# the job accounting data.
StoragePass={{slurmdbd_mysql_pwd}}

# StoragePort
# The port number that the Slurm Database Daemon (slurmdbd)
# communicates with the database.

# StorageType
# Define the accounting storage mechanism type. Acceptable values
# at present include "accounting_storage/gold",
# "accounting_storage/mysql", and "accounting_storage/pgsql".
# The value "accounting_storage/gold" indicates that account
# records will be written to Gold
# (http://www.clusterresources.com/pages/products/gold-allocation-manager.php),
# which maintains its own database. The value
# "accounting_storage/mysql" indicates that accounting records
# should be written to a MySQL database specified by the StorageLoc
# parameter. The value "accounting_storage/pgsql" indicates that
# accounting records should be written to a PostgreSQL database
# specified by the StorageLoc parameter. This value must be
# specified.
StorageType=accounting_storage/mysql

# StorageUser
# Define the name of the user we are going to connect to the
# database with to store the job accounting data.
StorageUser={{slurmdbd_mysql_user}}

# LogFile
# Fully qualified pathname of a file into which the Slurm Database
# Daemon’s logs are written. The default value is none (performs
# logging via syslog).
LogFile=/var/log/{{slurm_name}}/slurmdbd.log

# PidFile
# Fully qualified pathname of a file into which the Slurm Database
# Daemon may write its process ID. This may be used for automate
# signal processing. The default value is "/var/run/slurmdbd.pid".
PidFile=/var/run/slurmdbd.pid

# SlurmUser
# The name of the user that the slurmctld daemon executes as.
# This user must exist on the machine executing the Slurm Database
# Daemon and have the same user ID as the hosts on which slurmctld
# execute. For security purposes, a user other than "root" is
# recommended. The default value is "root".
