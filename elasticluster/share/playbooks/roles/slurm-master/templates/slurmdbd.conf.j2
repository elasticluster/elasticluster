# control data visibility
#
# This controls what type of information is hidden from regular users.
# By default, all information is visible to all users.  User
# SlurmUser, root, and users with AdminLevel=Admin can always view all
# information.  Multiple values may be specified with a comma
# separator.  Acceptable values include:
#
# accounts
#        prevents users from viewing any account definitions unless
#        they are coordinators of them.
#
# jobs
#        prevents users from viewing job records belonging to other
#        users unless they are coordinators of the association running
#        the job when using sacct.
#
# reservations
#        restricts getting reservation information to users with
#        operator status and above.
#
# usage
#        prevents users from viewing usage of any other user.  This
#        applies to sreport.
#
# users
#        prevents users from viewing information of any user other
#        than themselves, this also makes it so users can only see
#        associations they deal with.  Coordinators can see
#        associations of all users they are coordinator of, but can
#        only see themselves when listing users.

# By default, accouting records are never purged, which is fine for
# us.  If we ever want to enable purging, we should also enable the
# `Archive*` options which allow saving the data that is about to be
# purged from the DB.

# A Wckey is an orthogonal way to do accounting against maybe a group
# of unrelated accounts. WCKeys can be defined using sacctmgr add
# wckey 'name'. When a job is run use srun --wckey and time will be
# summed up for this wckey.
