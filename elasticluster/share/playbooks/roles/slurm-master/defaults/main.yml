  # Around April 2018, GCP seems to have started replacing the `.` in
  # user names (e.g. `riccardo.murri` as extracted from the email
  # address `riccardo.murri@gmail.com`) with a `_` when creating the
  # account names on VMs -- so be sure we do the same.  Still, since I
  # do not know when this started, and whether *all* images do this,
  # let us keep *both* spellings.
