  # `pbs_server` keeps running even when passed the `-t create` option
  # but does not create the PID file, and the systemd startup script
  # allows no way of passing options to `pbs_server` so we cannot use
  # it to force creation of the DB... solution is to run `pbs_server`
  # directly but supervisioned by the `timeout` command so that it's
  # killed quickly

  # `pbs_server` (the `--preserve-status` option was added only
  # recently), but Ansible will set `rc` to 0 if the command was
  # skipped because `serverdb` already exists
