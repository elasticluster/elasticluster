# spark-worker/tasks/main.yml
---

# The post-installation script of package `spark-worker` tries to run `service
# spark-worker start` which is bound to fail since we intend to run Spark on top
# of YARN and have not configured the standalone worker. So the failure prevents
# the package from being correctly installed (according to `dpkg`, the
# "configure" step fails), and everything goes south from there. So just tell
# systemd to ignore all requests related to `spark-worker` and everybody is
# happy.
