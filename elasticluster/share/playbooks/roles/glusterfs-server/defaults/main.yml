# Define GlusterFS volumes to be created and exported.
#
# Each item in this list must be an associative array with the
# following keys:
#
# - `name`: name seen & used by clients to mount the volume
#
# - `path`: actual storage path ("brick" in GlusterFS nomenclature);
#   is the same on all server hosts (this is a limitation of this -
#   playbook, not of GlusterFS itself)
#
# - `replicas`: number of online replicas for each file; omit to use GlusterFS' default
#
# - `stripes`: striping factor of the volume; omit to use GlusterFS' default
#
# - `transport`: transport option for the GlusterFS daemon (as of
#   version 3.7.3, one of: `tcp`, `rdma`, or `tcp,rdma`), , or the -
#   empty string `''` to use GlusterFS' default
#
# The `replicas`, `stripes`, and `transport` keys are optional, and
# GlusterFS defaults are used if omitted.

# selection logic.)

# that runs GlusterFS commands, ``False`` elsewhere.  By default, use
# the first server node.
