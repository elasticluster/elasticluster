# Define GlusterFS volumes to be created and exported.
#
# Each item in this list must be an associative array with the
# following keys:
#
# - `name`: name seen & used by clients to mount the volume
#
# - `path`: actual storage path ("brick" in GlusterFS nomenclature);
#   is the same on all server hosts (this is a limitation of this -
#   playbook, not of GlusterFS itself)
#
# - `redundancy`: number of servers that can go offline before the
#   GlusterFS volume stops being operational.  If this is set to any
#   value > 0, forces the volume to be "dispersed", which is
#   incompatible with striping and replication; hence, this option is
#   mutually exclusive with `replicas` and `stripes` (see below).
#   Default is 0, i.e., do not create a dispersed volume.
#
# - `replicas`: number of online replicas for each file; omit to use GlusterFS' default
#
# - `stripes`: striping factor of the volume; omit to use GlusterFS' default
#
# - `transport`: transport option for the GlusterFS daemon (as of
#   version 3.12.3, one of: `tcp`, `rdma`, or `tcp,rdma`).  Default
#   is `tcp`.
#
# The `replicas`, `stripes`, and `transport` keys are optional, and
# GlusterFS defaults are used if omitted.
#
GLUSTERFS_VOLUMES:
  - name: 'glusterfs'
    path: '/srv/glusterfs'
    redundancy: 0
    replicas: ''
    stripes: ''


# GlusterFS setup commands should be issued on one single server in
# the whole cluster; name that host here.  (I'm not sure there is a
# sane default for this setting, feel free to suggest an alternate
# selection logic.)
