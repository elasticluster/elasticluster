# The following code is an attempt at getting MathWorks' official "MATLAB Engine
# API for Python" to work, instead of the `pymatbridge` Python package (which is
# still labeled as status "3 - Alpha" on PyPI).
#
# Unfortunately, as of MATLAB 2016a, the MATLAB Engine API only supports Python
# 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4. Since the provided Python module is a *binary* one
# (`libmatlabforpython3_4.so`), we cannot play any diff/patch/symlink tricks.
#
# So here you go, code that only works for Python 2 and little chances of
# ever working with the *current* Python 3.
