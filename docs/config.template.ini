# Elasticluster Configuration Template
# ====================================
#
# This configuration file is used to define the following properties to run elasticluster:
# - cloud (login data, url)
# - cluster (size, security, cloud provider, etc.)
#


# Cloud Section
# =============
#
# The cloud section defines all properties to connect to the cloud provider and specifies a 
# library to use to connect and manage instances.
#
# Naming:
# By giving different names for a cloud entry, different cloud providers (e.g. openstack, amazone, etc.)
# can be managed with the same configuration.
# [cloud/name]: replace 'name' with whatever matches the entry in your cluster section 
#
# Options:
# provider: implementation to use to connect to the cloud (available: ec2_boto)
# ec2_url: url to connect to the cloud (http://url:port/path)
# region: region to connect to
# ec2_access_key: access key
# ec2_secret_key: secret key
#

# TODO: default values for user_keys

[cloud/%name%]
provider=ec2_boto
ec2_url=
ec2_access_key=
ec2_secret_key=
ec2_region=nova


# Login Section
# ===============
#
# The login section defines all properties to connect to the nodes within the cluster.
#
#
# Naming:
# By giving different names for a login entry, multiple clusters can reference the same login information.
# [login/name]: replace 'name' with whatever name you will recognize your login
#
# image_user: username to be able to connect to (set on the image)
# image_user_sudo: username to be able to have su rights (e.g. root)
# image_sudo: True if sudo is needed for su rights, False if the user has su rights
# user_key_name: name of the key that is recognized by the cloud
# user_key_private: path to the private key
# user_key_public: path to the public key

# Cluster Section
# ===============
#
# The cluster section defines all properties to start and manage a cluster.
#
#
# Naming:
# By giving different names for a cluster entry, multiple clusters can be managed through elasticluster.
# [cluster/name]: replace 'name' with whatever name you will recognize your cluster :) 
#
# Mandatory Options:
# cloud: defines the cloud name to run the instance on (see section above)
# setup_provider: name of a defined provider (see section below) 
# frontend: number of frontend nodes (only 1 supported yet!)
# compute: number of compute nodes
# login: login section to use to setup cluster and connect to nodes etc. (see section above)
# 
# Overwritable Options:
# (The following options can be defined for the cluster and then overwritten in the compute/frontend section. 
#  Either way they have to be defined to properly run a cluster)
# image: name of the instance image
# flavor: flavor of the instance (e.g. m1.tiny, m1.medium, etc.)
# security-group: cloud security group name to assign the node to
# image_userdata: content of a shell script to be executed right after the vm is started

# Compute/Frontend Section
# ========================
#
# The compute/frontend section defines all instance properties for a compute or frontend node.
#
#
# Naming:
# The compute nodes of a cluster can have different instance properties than the frontend.
# [cluster/name/compute]: replace 'name' with the cluster the compute node settings belong to
# [cluster/name/frontend]:  replace 'name' with the cluster the compute node settings belong to
#
# Options to possibly overwrite:
# (The following options can overwrite the properties from the cluster section (if defined). Either way,
# they have to be defined in one section to properly function.)
# image: name of the instance image
# flavor: flavor of the instance (e.g. m1.tiny, m1.medium, etc.)
# security-group: cloud security group name to assign the node to

# Setup Section
# 

#
# Ansible Setup Manager
#
# Mandatory Options:
# provider: implementation to use for this setup manager (available: ansible)
# playbook_path: path to the playbook
# frontend_groups: defined frontend node groups of your playbook (used to build the inventory)
# compute_groups: defined compute node groups of your playbook (used to build the inventory)
