## conditional dependencies
#
# Although PEP-508 and a number of predecessors specify a syntax for
# conditional dependencies in Python packages, support for it is inconsistent
# (at best) among the PyPA tools. An attempt to use the conditional syntax has
# already caused issues #308, #249, #227, and many more headaches to me while
# trying to find a combination of

# `pip`, `setuptools`, `wheel`, and dependency
# specification syntax that would work reliably across all supported Linux
# distributions. I give up, and revert to computing the dependencies via
# explicit Python code in `setup.py`; this will possibly break wheels but it's
# the least damage I can do ATM.
