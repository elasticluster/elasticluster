ElastiCluster_ aims to provide a user-friendly command line tool to
create, manage and setup computing clusters hosted on cloud
infrastructures (like `Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud EC2`_, `Google
Compute Engine`_, or a private OpenStack_ cloud). Its main goal is
to get your own private cluster up and running with just a few
commands; this video_ demoes ElastiCluster setting up a
computational batch-queueing cluster.

Complete documentation for ElastiCluster is available on the `Read The
Docs <http://elasticluster.readthedocs.org/>`_ website.  General
discussion over ElastiCluster's usage, features, and bugs takes place
on the `elasticluster@googlegroups.com
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elasticluster>`_ mailing-list
(only subscribers can post).

The ElastiCluster_ project is an effort of the `Services and Support
for Science IT`_ (S3IT) unit at the `University of Zurich`_, licensed
under the `GNU General Public License version 3`_.


Features
========

ElastiCluster_ is in active development, and offers the following
features at the moment:

* INI-style configuration file to define cluster templates
* Can start and manage multiple independent clusters at the same time
* Automated setup of:
 * HPC clusters using SLURM_ or GridEngine_ (incl. support for CUDA-enabled GPUs);
 * Spark_ / Hadoop_ clusters with HDFS and Hive/SQL;
 * distributed storage clusters using GlusterFS_, OrangeFS_, or Ceph_;
 * ...or anything that you can install with an Ansible_ playbook!
* Growing and shrinking a running cluster.

ElastiCluster_ is currently in active development: please use the
GitHub issue tracker to file `enhancement requests and ideas`_,
or the `mailing-list`_ for discussion.

We appreciate pull requests for new features and enhancements. Please
use the *master* branch as starting point.


Quickstart
==========

The simplest way to run ElastiCluster is to use the official Docker
image.  If you cannot or want not to use Docker, please see alternate
installation instructions on `ElastiCluster's Read The Docs
<http://elasticluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_ website.

To install ElastiCluster over Docker: (1) download the `elasticluster.sh`_ script
script into a file `elasticluster.sh`, then (2) type this at your terminal
prompt::

    chmod +x elasticluster.sh

That's it!  You can now check that ElastiCluster is ready by running::

    elasticluster.sh --help

The first time it is run, the `elasticluster.sh`_ script will check if
Docker is installed, and ask for permission to install it if Docker is
not found. Follow the on-screen instructions; see section `Getting
Help`_ if you're in trouble.

You can also rename file ``elasticluster.sh`` to ``elasticluster``, if
you so like, to be consistent with the rest of the documentation.

.. _`elasticluster.sh`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gc3-uzh-ch/elasticluster/master/elasticluster.sh

Alternatively, you can also perform both steps at the terminal prompt::

    # use this if the `wget` command is installed
    wget -O elasticluster.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gc3-uzh-ch/elasticluster/master/elasticluster.sh
    chmod +x elasticluster.sh

    # use this if the `curl` command is installed instead
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gc3-uzh-ch/elasticluster/master/elasticluster.sh
    chmod +x elasticluster.sh

Choose either one of the two methods above, depending on whether
``wget`` or ``curl`` is installed on your system (Linux systems
normally have ``wget``; MacOSX normally uses ``curl``).

After ElastiCluster is installed, run this command to deploy an `example
configuration file`_::

  elasticluster list-templates

The configuration file is located in `.elasticluster/config`; adjust it
to your liking using the `configuration reference`__.

More example configurations for popular cluster types can be found in
the `examples/`__ directory.

Getting help
============

For anything concerning ElastiCluster, including trouble running the
installation script, please send an email to
`elasticluster@googlegroups.com
<mailto:elasticluster@googlegroups.com>`_ or post a message on the web
forum `<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elasticluster>`_.
Include the full output of the script in your email, in order to help
us to identify the problem.
